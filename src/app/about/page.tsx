                <p className=" mb-4">
                  By strategically obtaining capabilities that allow us to
                  introduce products with minimal development periods and
                  required initial capital, followed by a phase of scaling, we
                  aim to quickly capture market segments. By building a brand
                  expectation, we expect easier market penetration for
                  successive products. This demand-first approach provides us
                  with crucial information in identifying products across all
                  sectors of interest. Guided by our company principles, we will
                  achieve high product satisfaction and rapid market
                  acquisition.
